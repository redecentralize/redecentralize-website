While interviewing the people making projects, and talking to all sorts of people, 
I've found four major different reasons people care about decentralization.

## 1. Privacy 

This is the most visible and activate motivation - particularly since Snowden
showed how the economic cost of reading our personal messages just isn't high
enough.

Lots of the well known recent decentralization projects were started by people
who care about privacy. They don't like centrally run services, as they are
easier to snoop on.

## 2. Resilience 

Much like privacy a few years ago, there are some people who know our systems
won't cope with disaster, but it isn't yet an active political issue.

A hurricane, a civil war, a severe disease epidemic... The web and telephones
basically stop working. If the transatlantic cable was cut, I should still be
able to send email to other people in Liverpool.

## 3. Competition 

This is a surprisingly broad motivation. 

Part of it is large tech companies reducing competition by controlling the stack.
For example, a proper decentralized marketplace helps artists compete at selling
music in whatever way they like.

Part of it is cultural. A monopoly in selling fizzy water doesn't matter so
much, as you can drink something else. Much more insidious are the newly
forming monopolies in information flow, as information informs everything else.

## 4. Fun

We've stalled on innovation in information systems, because of a lack of new
standards. In the past, new popular standards, such as the web, allowed
innovation from what were then startups, such as Amazon and Google.

You can get very specific kinds of innovation from a large company without new
open standards. You don't get really big changes though. For those you need
backing from everyone - Samsung are never going to back a proprietary Apple
"standard".

Why's this section called "fun"? Some tech geeks find expermenting and playing
with information systems in radically new ways great fun. They are the set of
people who create amazing new open standards.

## Conclusion

Whatever your motivation for decentralization, we hope you help these projects
improve how computers work for everyone.
