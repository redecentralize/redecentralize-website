   <h1>What is redecentralization?</h1>
    <p class="lead">We’re at the start of a new information revolution.
    The last one was the printing press. 
    </p>
      
    <p>It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#History">took centuries</a>
      for us to work out how to use print fairly. Concepts like copyright, the
      novel and libraries were formed, which we all take for granted now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it seems like lots has happened... personal computers, the world
      wide web, smart phones… Really, it’s only just begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Internet was decentralized. Anyone could set up parts of it.
      That’s why it won.
    </p>
    <p>
      For various reasons, control of our information technologies is
      increasingly falling into a few hands. Some big companies and Governments.
    </p>
    <p><b>We want it to become decentralized. Again.</b></p>

    <h2>Why did Redecentralize.org start?</h2>

     <h2>Why should anyone care?</h2>
    <p>Motivations for decentralizing the internet vary. These four keep coming up:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Resilience</strong> - whether there’s a hurricane, a severed
        trans-atlantic cable or just a train line with a poor connection, we’d
        like to be able to carry on making phone calls and sharing documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Privacy</strong> - as a company keeping our commercial secrets,
        or as an individual concerned about our government overstepping the
        line, we'd like our most personal messages not to be held in distant
        data centres.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Competition</strong> - instead of being buyers forced to buy
        books from one store, or sellers forced to use one payment processor,
        we'd like democratic digital marketplaces and currencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Innovation</strong> - innovation on the network is slowing down, and
        increasingly either superficial or limited to large companies. Instead,
        we'd like our community to form new protocols so that creative new
        services can be built.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What’s Redecentralize.org do?</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to get decentralized products into the hands of billions.</p>
    <p>We help build the communities and networks needed to make that happen.</p>
    <p>We’re not going to build technology or products ourselves.</p>
    <p>So far we've &hellip;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interviewed dozens of founders</li>
        <li>Run a successful conference</li>
        <li>Built directories of apps</li>
        <li>Held local meetups in many cities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will do things like &hellip;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>help market the concepts, the people, the products</li>
      <li>build a shared language for decentralization</li>
      <li>host events and online communities</li>
      <li>speak about the movement in the media</li>
      <li>research what business models will work</li>
      <li>attract financiers whether VCs, Government or the crowd</li>
